# Stack Implementation

This is a template based Stack implementation that I was talking about. This is a very basic implementation. Try to do the **Steps to Reproduce** to make this yourselves.

## Steps to reproduce
Assuming VS Code usage. But should be able to reproduce anywhere.

1. Create Console project
```
Run the following command:

$ dotnet new console -o Stack
```
2. Rename the Project folder name if you want (Optional and not necessary)

3. Create `Stack.cs` file and add code
4. Edit `Program.cs` file to add the running code.
5. Right Click on `WeekOne` Folder and select `Open in Terminal` option.
6. Run the Project
```
$ dotnet run
```
