# Implementations of FantaCode Backend Team Tasks

This repository will provide the basic implementations of Tasks given to interns on each week. Please note that not all tasks may not be present here, and in some cases a task submission maybe added as the example implementation. Details of each submissions maybe viewed under their respective sub folders. Wherever necessary there is a `Steps to Reproduce` Section that will provide the basic steps to reproduce these tasks.
